		<h2>About Us</h2>
		<h4>Mission Statement</h4>
		<p>To have no one worry about unfinished art projects or an excess of materials taking up space.</p>
		<h4>How it Began</h4>
		<p>The founder of Crafts Emporium, Janelle Torro, had a passion for arts and crafts for as long as she could remember. Back in the day, whenever a crafting idea came to mind she would scavenge in and around the house to find all the pieces that were needed to build the craft. Often times, it resulted in her having to stop a crafting project midway because she would run out of supplies. Being continously frustrated with having to pull herself from crafting, Janelle came up with the idea for her company, Crafts Emporium. She has long since said goodbye to the countless frustrations in running short of the supplies a craft she wanted to build needed. Crafts Emporium stocks bundles of all sorts of craft projects that were put together after each project has been built at least once before. Janelle and her employees keep careful record of the supplies needed as the craft project is being built and meticuously add just the right amount to each craft package, accounting for any mistakes that may be made along the way by the craftee. Janelle is passionate about her company and the quality of her products, and it shows with her many devoted customers.</p>
